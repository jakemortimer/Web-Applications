Welcome to your new branch Ty. Remember to read the "README.md" file that I have
made and once you have finished a project remember to merge the master branch and
yours. Once you see this message and have understood the instructions make sure that 
you delete this message from your branch; we don't want problems with merging when it
comes to it.
Thanks and enjoy,
